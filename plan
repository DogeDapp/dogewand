Merging users:

User already has account with other provider(s). They receive a tip on a new provider, and are not
signed in to that provider. They claim the tip using the new user resolve flow. A new account is created.

Option 1:

Do you already have a dogewand account? Click here to merge accounts.
Need both users. NOTE: profile info is effectively same as user object.
Use passport authorize, then use profile info to look up additional account.
When you have the additional account, choose which direction to merge in.

Get balance of merge account. Move all funds from merge account to the other account.
Add auth info from merge account into other account. Delete merge account.


Want to move *to* otheraccount:
When one has accepted a tip on a new provider, creating superflous account, which one is logged into
at the time.

Want to move *from* otheraccount:
When one would like to start tipping on a new provider and is logged into the account one would like
to tip with.


Is there anything bad that happens if one merges a whole array of providers and not just one?

- Not that I can think of right now


Option 2:




Iframe comms flow:

option 1

* Loader opens iframe
* Saves reference to iframe
* Sends version to iframe
* iframe checks version, maybe pops update modal

option 2

* Loader opens Iframe
* Iframe sends hello message
* Loader saves reference to iframe
* Sends version to iframe
* iframe checks version, maybe pops update modal

TODO:

* API tests
* Automatically update balances from deposits
* Deal with remaining login jank
*


Putting whole thing in iframe-

  * Load zepto twice- fuck it (maybe use native dom stuff??)
  * Channel.js framework if needed? probably not right now
  * Just seperate the shit out, put dom scraping stuff outside.

  * Seperate lib file in iframe- like normal website
  * Still concatting everything outside

  Outside script functionality:
    * Load and resize iframe
    * Page scraping functionality
    * Talk to stuff inside
    * Does it need to even do any ajax???
    * Be as small as possible

  Iframe script functionality:
    * Send resize messages
    * Pop modals
    * Display forms
    * Send ajax or possibly just form submits?
    * MVP for toolbar, balance. later, tips lists

  Preprocessing needed:

    Outside script:
      * Concat lib stuff
      * Minify
      * Incremental not needed? (unless there is html or smthing?)

    Iframe script:
      * Same stuff from before- incremental etc.
      * Put css straight in page, process seperately

How to show tip confirmation

1. Send close postmessage on submit

  Pros
    * Simplest

  Cons
    * Will need to reload tips in extension, likely race condition


2. Send post with js in iframe, send closer postmessage with data to extension

  Pros
    * Most elegant

  Cons
    * Need to write xmlhhtp requests or load zepto or other lib redundantly


3. Redirect to iframe closer page, load tip confirmation in extension upon close

  Pros
    * Simple
    * Eliminates race condition by controlling timing

  Cons
    * Need to make another request


4. Submit form normally, redirect to closer page with templated-in data.

  Pros
    * Simple to build

  Cons
    * Weird


5. Submit form normally, reload page with flash message with tip data for extension.

  Pros
    * Existing solutions
    * Flash messages will be good to have for other stuff?

  Cons
    * Old school?
    * Reload flicker
    * Need to learn new module
