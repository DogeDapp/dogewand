plan




Putting whole thing in iframe-

  * Load zepto twice- fuck it (maybe use native dom stuff??)
  * Channel.js framework if needed? probably not right now
  * Just seperate the shit out, put dom scraping stuff outside.

  * Seperate lib file in iframe- like normal website
  * Still concatting everything outside

  Outside script functionality:
    * Load and resize iframe
    * Page scraping functionality
    * Talk to stuff inside
    * Does it need to even do any ajax???
    * Be as small as possible

  Iframe script functionality:
    * Send resize messages
    * Pop modals
    * Display forms
    * Send ajax or possibly just form submits?
    * MVP for toolbar, balance. later, tips lists

  Preprocessing needed:

    Outside script:
      * Concat lib stuff
      * Minify
      * Incremental not needed? (unless there is html or smthing?)

    Iframe script:
      * Same stuff from before- incremental etc.
      * Put css straight in page, process seperately

How to show tip confirmation

1. Send close postmessage on submit

  Pros
    * Simplest

  Cons
    * Will need to reload tips in extension, likely race condition


2. Send post with js in iframe, send closer postmessage with data to extension

  Pros
    * Most elegant

  Cons
    * Need to write xmlhhtp requests or load zepto or other lib redundantly


3. Redirect to iframe closer page, load tip confirmation in extension upon close

  Pros
    * Simple
    * Eliminates race condition by controlling timing

  Cons
    * Need to make another request


4. Submit form normally, redirect to closer page with templated-in data.

  Pros
    * Simple to build

  Cons
    * Weird


5. Submit form normally, reload page with flash message with tip data for extension.

  Pros
    * Existing solutions
    * Flash messages will be good to have for other stuff?

  Cons
    * Old school?
    * Reload flicker
    * Need to learn new module
